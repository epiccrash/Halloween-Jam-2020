** ... made using a the old cut and paste technique, from a scan of hand-drawn letters using a particularly thick, wet blue STABILO permanent ink marker on recycled porous paper, then scaled "manually" ... it was cool to paste images directly into the program and have it convert the image into a vectorized glyph (other programs I've used let you paste, but then you have to perform a "trace" operation ... I didn't see options for the cut and paste so as to allow a fine tuning of the glyph to be inserted ... more later, once I finish the other font I'm making with this neato *free* program
